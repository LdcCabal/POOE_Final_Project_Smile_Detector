# POOE_Final_Project_Smile_Detector
Using Machine Learning in python, this project was created as a Final Project to the course "Programaci√≥n Orientada a Objetos y Eventos". We train the model and use this to take a photo of us and make it detect if we are smiling or not. (First approach to machine learning)
